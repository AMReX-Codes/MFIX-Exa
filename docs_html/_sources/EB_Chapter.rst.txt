Embedded Boundaries
===================

MFIX-Exa uses AMReX's Embedded Boundaries to represent container walls. This
allows MFIX-Exa to simulate a wide range of shapes and boundary conditions using
constructive solid geometry. MFIX-Exa also has the capability of locally
refining the computational meshes near walls.
